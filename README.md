Liquity is a decentralized protocol that allows Ether holders to obtain maximum liquidity against
their collateral without paying interest. After locking up ETH as collateral in a smart contract and
creating an individual position called a "trove", the user can get instant liquidity by minting LQTY,
a USD-pegged stablecoin. Each trove is required to be collat- eralized at a minimum of 110%. Any
owner of LQTY can redeem their stablecoins for the underlying collateral at any time. The redemption
mechanism along with algorithmically adjusted fees guarantee a minimum stablecoin value of USD 1.

An unprecedented liquidation mechanism based on incentivized stability deposits and a redistribution
cycle from riskier to safer troves provides stability at a much lower collateral ratio than current
systems. Stability is maintained via economically-driven user interactions and arbitrage, rather
than by active governance or monetary interventions.

The protocol has built-in incentives that encourage both early adoption and the operation of
multiple front ends, enhancing decentralization.
